## Project Description

Metacritic's mission is to help consumers make an informed decision about how to spend their time and money on entertainment. They believe that multiple opinions are better than one, user voices can be as important as critics, and opinions must be scored to be easy to use. With a focus on Metacritics video game data, I will try see if there is a trend in what makes a video game suceed or fail. Is there a specific category that does better, for example First Person Shooters vs Sports? Or maybe graphics has a large part to play. By using machine clustering and classification modeling, I hope to find a way to predict whether a new game will do well after release.
